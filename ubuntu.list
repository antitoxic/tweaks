## Disable keyboard shortcuts
From "Keyboard" app and Compi.zConfig Settings Manager (ccsm). Disable things like "Alt+F1" and other global shortcuts.


## Recoding screencasts as GIF animations

Copy the contents of `byzanz` folder to `~/scripts`.

Make the scripts executable

```bash
cd ~/scripts
chmod +x byzanz-record-region
chmod +x byzanz-record-window
```

Satisfy the dependacies (only `xrectsel`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lolilolicon/FFcast2.git ~/tmp/xrectsel
cd ~/tmp/xrectsel
make
sudo make install
rm -R ~/tmp/xrectsel
```

Make custom keyboard shortcut for capturing region of the screen via the "Keyboard" app. The the command that you'll assign for the shortcut would be:

```bash
bash /home/<<your-username>>/scripts/byzanz-record-region
```

Now, when you press your shortcut you'll start recording. When you press the shortcut again it will stop recording.
